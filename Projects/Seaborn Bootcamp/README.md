# üìä Seaborn Bootcamp Data Visualization App using Streamlit

Welcome to the **Seaborn Bootcamp** project! This is an interactive data visualization app built using **Streamlit** and **Seaborn**, allowing users to explore insights from the classic **`tips` dataset** using various types of plots.

---

## üìå Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a data science bootcamp. The goal is to learn and demonstrate:

- How to use Seaborn for rich statistical visualizations
- How to build interactive visualization dashboards using Streamlit
- How to explore a dataset visually and draw insights

The `tips` dataset is used here, which is pre-loaded in Seaborn. It contains details about restaurant bills, tips, customer demographics, and dining time.

## üìö Dataset Information

The dataset used is Seaborn's inbuilt **`tips`** dataset. It contains 244 rows and 7 columns.
