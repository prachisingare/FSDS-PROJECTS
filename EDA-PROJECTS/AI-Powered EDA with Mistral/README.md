# 🚢 Titanic EDA and AI-Powered Insight Generator

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset and provides **AI-generated insights** using a locally running language model. It also offers an interactive **Gradio web application** where users can upload any Titanic-style CSV file and receive automated insights.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project combines traditional data analysis with the power of AI:

- ✅ Loads Titanic dataset (`titanic_dataset_final.csv`)
- 📊 Visualizes distributions, survival counts, and stats
- 🔍 Identifies and handles missing values
- 🧠 Uses Ollama + Mistral LLM to generate human-like data insights
- 🌐 Hosted on a Gradio UI for easy access

## 📁 Dataset Details

The Titanic dataset contains 891 rows × 12 columns with the following key features:

- `PassengerId` — Unique ID for each passenger  
- `Survived` — Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)  
- `Pclass` — Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)  
- `Name`, `Sex`, `Age`, `SibSp`, `Parch`, `Ticket`, `Fare`, `Cabin`, `Embarked`  

> 🔎 Missing values are handled and analyzed before plotting or generating insights.

## 🧠 Sample AI Insight (Generated by Mistral via Ollama)
"The dataset has 891 records. Around 38% survived. Most passengers were in third class. Age ranges from infants to 80 years old. Fare values vary significantly, suggesting class-based inequality. Most passengers traveled alone."
