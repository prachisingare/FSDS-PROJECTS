# ⚽ FIFA 19 Data Visualization - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **FIFA 19 player dataset**, revealing patterns, distributions, and relationships using Python visualization libraries like **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The dataset contains attributes for over 18,000 players, including their age, nationality, club, preferred foot, ratings, physical attributes, and more.  
Through this project, we aim to:

- Understand the distribution of key player attributes.
- Analyze player potential based on international reputation.
- Visualize performance statistics using advanced plots.
- Compare players based on their preferred foot, positions, and skills.

---
## 📊 Key Techniques

- **Data Cleaning**: Dropped unnamed columns, handled missing values.
- **Univariate Analysis**: Distribution plots (distplot, hist), count plots.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Strip plots, box plots, violin plots, bar plots.
- **Multivariate Analysis**: PairGrid, JointGrid, FacetGrid.
- **Statistical Visualization**: regplot, lmplot, pointplot.

## 🔍 Sample Visualizations

- Age distribution using `distplot`
- Preferred foot analysis with `countplot` & `catplot`
- Relationship between potential and international reputation via `stripplot`, `violinplot`, and `pointplot`
- Scatter and line plots between strength, stamina, and overall rating
- Advanced Seaborn plots like `FacetGrid`, `PairGrid`, and `JointGrid`

---

## 📚 Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

---
## ✅ Summary

- Right-footed players dominate
- Most players are aged 20–30
- Higher reputation correlates with higher potential
- Unique player body types like "Messi" and "C. Ronaldo" are encoded separately.
