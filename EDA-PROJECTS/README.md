## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects
Welcome to my collection of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects!
Each folder in this repository contains an end-to-end EDA on a different dataset. These projects aim to uncover meaningful insights, visualize trends, and prepare data for further machine learning or statistical modeling.

## 🔍 What is EDA?
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of analyzing datasets to:

Summarize main characteristics

Visualize patterns and relationships

Handle missing or incorrect data

Detect outliers and anomalies

EDA is the foundation of every data science workflow.


## 🔍 Objectives
Understand the structure and contents of the dataset.

Identify and handle missing values.

Perform univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.

Visualize key relationships using plots (bar charts, heatmaps, scatter plots, box plots, etc.).

Detect outliers and anomalies.

Prepare data for modeling by feature understanding and transformation (if needed).



## 🧠 Goals of EDA

- Understand the structure and summary of the dataset.
- Handle missing or inconsistent values.
- Identify data distributions and relationships.
- Visualize key insights and correlations.
- Prepare data for future modeling.
